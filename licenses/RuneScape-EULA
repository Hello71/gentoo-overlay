Version 2.0 (19 May 2020)
END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT FOR RUNESCAPE AND OLD SCHOOL RUNESCAPE CLIENT

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

This end user licence agreement ("Licence") is a legal agreement between you and Jagex Limited of 220 Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, England, CB4 0WA relating to the software programs (known as "RuneScape Client" or "Old School RuneScape Client") and any updates, upgrades, patches or other modifications made to the software programs from time to time (collectively referred to as "Software").

Any reference to “Game” shall include both RuneScape or Old School RuneScape including all updates, upgrades, additional content, variations and expansion packs for the purposes of this Licence.

In this Licence you, the user of the Software, are referred to as "you" "your", "yours" and in this agreement we are referred to as "Jagex", "we", "us" or "our".

We license use of the Software to you on the basis of this Licence. We do not sell the Software to you and we remain the owners of the Software at all times.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL USERS:

This Licence governs the terms on which the Software is made available to you and the permitted use by you. By downloading or accessing the Software in any way (whether as part of the creation of an Account (defined below) or not and whether on any Jagex or third-party platform), you confirm that you are aged 18 years old or over and have read and accept the terms of this Licence, or if you are aged between 13 and 18, your parent or legal guardian has read and accepted the terms of this Licence. We may immediately terminate this Licence and stop your access to the Software if we are not satisfied that such acceptance by the parent or legal guardian has been given. You and your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must review the terms of this Licence together. Parents and legal guardians are responsible for the acts of children under 18 years of age when using the Software.

* BY CLICKING ON THE “YES” OR “INSTALL” BUTTON, OR BY ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE OR RELATED GAME IN ANY WAY, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE (AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE)AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH LICENCE TERMS ARE LEGALLY BINDING ON YOU.

1. GRANT AND SCOPE OF LICENCE

1.1 Subject to you complying with this Licence, we grant you a limited, revocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable licence to use the Software, solely for your personal and non-commercial use. To be clear, we consider the creation of an Account (defined below in Section 4) to access the Software in order to understand, analyse, decompile, reflect, alter, adapt, vary, reverse engineer, copy, reproduce, or transmit such authorised Software or do anything similar or equivalent, falls outside the scope of “personal and non-commercial use” and constitutes a material breach of the terms of this Licence.

1.2 When downloading and accessing the Software, or uploading content from the Software, standard network and/or broadband charges may apply. You may incur additional data charges from your network operator according to your contract with your relevant internet provider which you are solely responsible for.

2. RESTRICTIONS

2.1 Except as expressly set out in this Licence you undertake that you will not (and will not permit or encourage or procure others directly or indirectly to):

a. in whole or in part, copy, reproduce, disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer or create derivative works of the Software (or any part of it), except where such copying is incidental to normal use of the Software;

b. rent, sell, lease, sub-license, loan, publish, display, distribute or otherwise transfer to a third party the Software, any copy thereof, in whole or in part;

c. reflect, translate, alter, modify, merge, adapt, vary or make alterations to, or modifications of, the whole or any part of the Software, nor permit the Software or any part of it to be combined with, or become incorporated in, any other programs;

d. combine, associate, wrap-around, integrate, or align, any third-party software, components or add-on features with the Software or any part of it, in any manner whatsoever;

e. exploit or otherwise make available the Software or any of its parts for any purpose including any commercial purpose;

f. disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer or create derivative works based on the whole or any part of the Software or attempt to do any such things, except to the extent that such actions cannot be prohibited by law; and

g. bypass or seek to bypass any security or technical measures (including de-obfuscating any code) relating to the Software, including by the adoption of techniques and technologies now known or hereafter developed.

2.2 You must not use in connection with the Game any third-party software (including any game client which has not been developed by Jagex or licensed under this Licence) which undertakes or enables any of the restricted activities specified at Section 2.1 above in relation to the Software.

2.3 Any use of the Software not expressly authorised by the terms of this Licence is expressly prohibited. Any use of the Software in violation of the Licence and restrictions will be regarded both as a breach of the terms of this Licence and/or as an infringement of our intellectual property rights in and to the Software (as detailed below).

3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

3.1 You acknowledge, accept and agree that all title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Software and all copies thereof (including without limitation any titles, computer code, themes, objects, characters, storylines, catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, landscape designs, animations, sounds, musical compositions, recordings and audio-visual effects) anywhere in the world belong to us and/or our third-party licensors.

3.2 You acknowledge that rights in the Software are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no rights in, or to, the Software other than the right to use them in accordance with the terms of this Licence.

3.3 You acknowledge that you have no right in or have access to the Software in source code format unless otherwise as expressly provided within this Licence.

3.4 In no event will the Software be deemed to be "open-source" or "publicly available" software.

4. ACCOUNTS

4.1 In order to access and use the Software and access the Game (and this could be via a Jagex platform or a third-party platform), you may be asked to register and open an account ("Account") and provide certain personal information such as, for example, your name and email address ("Registration"). Our Privacy Policy explains how such information may be collected and used. Where the Account is created on a Jagex platform then the Account is governed by the Terms and Conditions. The terms of this Licence are automatically incorporated as part of the Terms and Conditions.

5. OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICES INTEGRATION AND THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

5.1 From time to time the Software may integrate with other third-party services or platforms.

5.2 These third-party services or platforms may generally require you to agree to the terms and conditions of such third-party supplier and set up a separate Account or register with the third-party supplier in order to receive the third-party services or platform(s). The terms on which those third-party services or platforms engage with you and share information or data with the Software or us, are specific to each third-party provider. You should make yourself aware of the terms and conditions of the third-party provider before agreeing to receive such third-party services or platforms.

5.3 The Software may use or include third-party software ("Third-Party Software"). A list of the current Third-Party Software used within either the RuneScape Client and/or within the Old School RuneScape Client is included at the Annex to this Licence, along with any conditions or restrictions to use. We reserve the right to update, change and add to this list of Third-Party Software, as applicable, from time to time.

6. SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CANCELLATIONS

6.1 You may need a subscription and/or make payments to access and use certain features of the Software. Subscriptions and payments with any refund and cancellations are governed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Licence and the Terms and Conditions.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

7.1 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, PERFORMANCE ASSURANCES OR GUARANTEES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION, QUALITY, SATISFACTION, UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. JAGEX DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL INTEROPERATE OR BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED.

7.2 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT THERE WILL BE NO FAILURES, ERRORS OR OMISSIONS OR LOSS OF TRANSMITTED INFORMATION, OR THAT NO VIRUSES WILL BE TRANSMITTED ON THE SOFTWARE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SOFTWARE AT TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING, OR THAT WE WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR THE SOFTWARE AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

7.3 YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED TO MEET YOUR INDIVIDUAL REQUIREMENTS AND THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE SOFTWARE MEETS YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

8.1 SUBJECT TO SECTION 8.3, JAGEX SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY USE OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES. FURTHER, JAGEX SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO DIGITAL ASSETS SUCH AS CHARACTERS, VIRTUAL GOODS OR CURRENCY IN THE GAME, ACCOUNTS OR STATISTICS. JAGEX SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ISP DISRUPTIONS, SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE FAILURES, OR ANY OTHER EVENT WHICH MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF DATA OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICE. IN NO EVENT WILL JAGEX BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

8.2 The Software is provided to you free of charge under the terms of this Licence. To the maximum extent permissible by law our total liability, whether arising in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise and including liability for losses, costs, expenses or damages shall not exceed (in the aggregate) an amount equivalent to the Subscription fees, relating to the Game, actually paid by you to Jagex during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of the cause of action first arising.

8.3 Nothing in this Licence shall limit or exclude our liability for: (a) death or personal injury resulting from our negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by English law.

9. TERMINATION

9.1 We may terminate this Licence and any user Account in the Game immediately if you commit a breach of this Licence.

9.2 Upon termination for any reason: (a) all rights granted to you under this Licence shall immediately cease; (b) you must immediately cease all activities authorised by this Licence; (c) you must immediately delete or remove the Software from all computer equipment in your possession, and (d) your access to and use of the Game under the Terms and Conditions will immediately cease and be terminated.
10. GENERAL

10.1 Each of the warranties and conditions (or rights and obligations) of this Licence operates separately.

10.2 If any provision, or part provision, of this Licence, including each of the warranties and conditions (or rights and obligations) is found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any court or competent authority, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, including the warranties and conditions of this Licence will not be affected.

10.3 We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Licence to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Licence. You may not transfer or assign your rights and obligations under this Licence to a third party.

10.4 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Licence, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations.

10.5 This Licence, its subject matter and its formation, are governed by the laws of England and Wales. You and we both agree that the courts of England will have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any dispute connected with this License or the Game.

10.6 This Licence constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, provided, however, that this Licence shall co-exist with, and shall not supersede, the Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy.

This Licence is drafted in the English language and may be translated into other languages. The English language version of this Licence shall prevail if there is a conflict or inconsistency or clarification required with other language versions.

The GNU General Public License (GPL)

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

    You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4.You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5.You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

    Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

Copyright (C) <year> <author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL

Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but only where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words "Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as provided by Sun in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
